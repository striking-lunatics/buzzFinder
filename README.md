## Motivation

## Installation

Run the following commands in the command line to get Drink Local up and running.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/striking-lunatics/buzzFinder.git
$ cd buzzFinder
$ npm install
```
Before starting your server be sure to install postcress.app and pgAdmin. This project uses postcress for its database. 

Install postcress.app here - ***http://postgresapp.com***.
Install pgAdmin3 here - ***https://www.pgadmin.org***.

Once postcress.app is installed you should see a small elephant icon in the upper right corner of your desktop. Click it, then click 'open psql'. Doing this will start a psql server on your computer. 

pgAdmin3 is a tool used to view your database in a table format. It is a convienent way to visually reference the database.

In order to get the databse up and running, run the following commands in the command line.

```
$ createdb buzzFinder 
$ knex migrate:latest 
```

You must name your database 'buzzFinder' as the server will be looking for this name. 

Finally, run
```
$ npm start
```

Open your browser to ***http://localhost:1337*** to view!
